# TestAPI

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)

A lightweight, modern, highly extensible API testing toolkit built on python, tkinter and requests.

The program is highly modular and affords the user both high and low level access to the request and response data.

The modular nature allows the user to write their own tests and show statistics as needed.
